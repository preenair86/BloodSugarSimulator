# BloodSugarSimulator
Simulate the blood glucose level of users based on food consumption and exercise data. 

This project develops a blood sugar simulator for users. The simulator allows users to monitor their daily blood sugar 
based on the amount of food they consume and the exercise they do during the day. This simulator will help clients 
lead a healthier life by monitoring and regulating their blood glucose level through careful food consumption and exercise habits.

The project is being implemented in Java and uses multiple technologies like J2EE, JSP, Hibernate, RESTful Webservices and Maven.
